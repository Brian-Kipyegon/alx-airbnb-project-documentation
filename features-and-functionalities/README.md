# Airbnb Clone Backend

This project is the backend implementation of an Airbnb-like platform, where users can register as guests or hosts, list properties, make bookings, pay, review listings, and manage all activities through an admin panel. The backend is built using modern web technologies to ensure scalability, security, and performance.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionalities

- **User Management**
  - User Registration (Guests & Hosts)
  - Login & Authentication (JWT, OAuth options like Google and Facebook)
  - Profile Management (Update contact info, profile photos, preferences)

- **Property Listings Management**
  - Add/Edit/Delete Listings
  - Fields: Title, Description, Location, Price, Amenities, Availability

- **Search & Filtering**
  - Search by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities
  - Pagination support for large datasets

- **Booking Management**
  - Create, manage, and cancel bookings
  - Prevent double booking using date validation
  - Track booking status (Pending, Confirmed, Canceled, Completed)

- **Payment Integration**
  - Payment gateway integration (Stripe / PayPal)
  - Support for multiple currencies
  - Automatic host payouts after booking completion

- **Reviews & Ratings**
  - Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties
  - Hosts can respond to reviews
  - Reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse

- **Notification System**
  - Email and in-app notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Admin interface to manage users, listings, bookings, and payments

### Technical Requirements

- **Database**: Use relational databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
  - Tables: Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, Payments
  
- **API Development**
  - RESTful API design with support for HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
  - Optional: GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - JWT for secure user sessions
  - Role-based access control (RBAC): Differentiating permissions between Guests, Hosts, and Admins

- **File Storage**
  - Use cloud storage solutions (AWS S3, Cloudinary) for profile and property images

- **Third-Party Services**
  - Email notifications via SendGrid or Mailgun

- **Error Handling & Logging**
  - Centralized error handling for API requests
  - Implement logging for server-side audit and debugging
